Aspiring full-stack web developer. Comfortable with making simple frontend websites using HTML/JS/CSS. Still building skills for frontend development but hope to understand backend as well in the coming months.<br>

Goals for this year:<br>
Long-term 1. Learn to write better and clean code as well as make more advanced website designs.<br>
Long-term 2. Make websites that benefit both me and other people.

Short-term 1. Understand the basics of backend development within a month.<br>
Short-term 2. Have at least 5 different projects down and submitted on my portfolio.

Goals will build while coding, just want to write it down as something to look back on as I push more code.
